# Ruby Drill Enumerable Methods

##Learning Competencies

##Summary

When you need to operate on a Ruby `Array`, you can accomplish just about anything you can imagine with the `each` method. Often, though, using `each` is not the best way to work with `Array`s.

For example, when you find yourself adding conditional logic inside your `each` block, or using `each` to search, sort, or transform the `Array`, consider the power of Ruby's `Enumerable` module.

Constraint: do not use the `for` or `each` method in any of your solutions to this Challenge. Besides these 2, any other enumerable method is up for grabs!

## Objectives

### Utilize Enumerable's other methods

Enumerable is chock full of useful, convenient methods that make working with enumerables much simpler. This exercise will expose you to a handful of these methods. Each method in the exercise tells you which Enumerable method you should use, so it's your job to figure out how to call it to perform the desired task.

Note: Be careful not to break the driver code.
